  <p> 12:20 pm | ok c is boring to learn, idk why but i just dont care for it as much as i do for js. even tho ive shit on python a lot before i just wanna learn something new, python is easy to tackle and if its fun ill stick with it for a bit. i think my main issue right now is that i just cant bring myself to care to make something in the ones i konw, everything is so fucking mind numbing no matter what, yet at least i somewhat enjoy experencing new things. </p>

  <p> 4:59 am | i really hate the people that say "oh i want a loser bf/gf" "oh i want a neet wife/husband" or whatever because that simply not true. theyve never actually been around people that are the type theyre talking about, if they did then they would be repulsed. they dont want a neet gf or bf they want the madeup version of someone thats a neet that they made in their head.</p>
  
    
       <h1>10/20/2025</h1>

    <p> people are so rotten i hate this world, you are a horrible people and deserve nothing but the worst. why must i live among you people, you do nothing but bring pain and misery to anything you touch. death isnt enough for some (most) people that walk this earth, how do people sleep at night knowing who they are. im not a good person either, so ill see you in hell i guess.</p>
    
           <h1>10/27/2025</h1>
